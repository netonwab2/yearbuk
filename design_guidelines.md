I need to see the uploaded app files to generate specific design guidelines for your project. However, I don't have access to the code you've uploaded in this conversation.

**To proceed, I need you to either:**
1. Share the main files of your uploaded app (HTML, CSS, JS structure)
2. Describe what your app does and what pages/features it has
3. Confirm if you want generic modern web app design guidelines

**Quick clarification:** What type of web application did you upload? (e.g., dashboard, landing page, e-commerce, social platform, productivity tool, etc.)

Once you provide this information, I'll generate concise, decisive design guidelines tailored specifically to your app - optimized for token efficiency while maintaining comprehensive coverage.
